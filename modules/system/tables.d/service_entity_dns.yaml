 Resource records that have to be present to use a service. The records
 in this table can be understood as 'templates'. The table does not
 contain a name (domain) for the records. Rather for every domain that
 uses this service, all appropriate records are created for this domain
 based on this table. The assignment from domain to services can
 be found in dns.service.
